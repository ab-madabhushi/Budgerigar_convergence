- The Budgerigar project.ipynb notebook contains code to conduct the co-occurrence analysis, compute note proportions, Shannon Entropy, Frequency of Repeat Lengths, Cohen's Randomisation test and code to plot these figures (No figure for Randomisation test). It also can be used to create various files used in the other analyses like the 'event sequences' i.e., instances of d note to make the raster figures. Matrix of repeat lengths of d-notes across warbles for the Principal component analysis to examine convergence.
- The Convergence_PC.m conducts PCA on the frequency of repeat length of d-notes across warbles and plots the convergence figure (Fig S4)
- budgie_stat.R conducts Wilcoxon test to examine differences in Shannon Entropy and Duration across colonies, across contexts.
- raster_final.m is used to make the raster figure in Fig S4 depicting instances and lengths of d-notes in the warbles. plotSpikeRaster.m is the file with the corresponding function to make a raster plot.
